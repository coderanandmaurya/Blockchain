There are various types of networks, which can be broadly categorized based on their size, scope, and functionality. Here are some common types of networks:

1. **Local Area Network (LAN):**
   - A LAN is a network that is limited to a small geographic area, such as a single building or a campus.
   - Devices in a LAN are typically connected with high data transfer rates.

2. **Wide Area Network (WAN):**
   - A WAN spans a larger geographic area, often connecting multiple LANs.
   - WANs can be used to connect remote offices or branch locations.

3. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):**
   - A MAN falls between a LAN and WAN in terms of geographic coverage.
   - It covers a larger geographic area than a LAN but is smaller than a WAN, typically serving a city or a large campus.

4. **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN):**
   - A WLAN uses wireless communication to connect devices within a limited area.
   - Wi-Fi networks are common examples of WLANs.

5. **Personal Area Network (PAN):**
   - A PAN is a network for personal devices within an individual's workspace.
   - Bluetooth is a technology often used for PANs.

6. **Client-Server Network:**
   - In a client-server network, multiple client devices (such as computers) are connected to a central server.
   - The server provides resources, services, or data to the clients.

7. **Peer-to-Peer Network:**
   - In a peer-to-peer network, all devices have equal status, and each device can act as both a client and a server.
   - Peer-to-peer networks are often simpler and used for small-scale setups.

8. **Internet:**
   - The Internet is a global network of networks that allows communication and data exchange worldwide.
   - It uses the TCP/IP protocol suite and supports various services like the World Wide Web, email, and file transfer.

9. **Intranet:**
   - An intranet is a private network within an organization that uses Internet technologies.
   - It is used for internal communication, collaboration, and information sharing.

10. **Extranet:**
    - An extranet is a controlled extension of an intranet, allowing specific external users (such as business partners or customers) to access a portion of the internal network.

11. **Virtual Private Network (VPN):**
    - A VPN is a secure network that uses encryption and tunneling protocols to enable secure communication over the Internet, often for remote access to a corporate network.

12. **Industrial Control System (ICS) and SCADA Networks:**
    - These networks are used in industrial settings to monitor and control processes, often in sectors like manufacturing, energy, and utilities.

These are just some examples, and there are many other specialized types of networks depending on specific requirements and applications.
